<!-- With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.
Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, by adding, removing, and manipulating elements. -->

  <!-- use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description. -->

  <!-- Bind the button's click event to the share() method in product-list.component.ts
  Event binding uses a set of parentheses, ( ), around the event, as in the (click) event on the <button> element. -->
